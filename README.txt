Thank you for your interest in the HFS+ Reader.

This software is intended to allow a Windows user to examine the contents of a disk 
formatted using Mac OS X, providing forensic information on the disk, partition, file 
system and the files contained within it. The application takes raw image files in 
.001 and .dmg format as input, including images split into multiple parts, such as 
the output produced by FTK Imager.
