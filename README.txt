Thank you for your interest in the HFS+ Reader.

This software is intended to allow a Windows user to examine the contents of a disk formatted using
Mac OS X, providing forensic information on the disk, partition, file system and the files 
contained within it. The application takes raw image files in .001 and .dmg format as input, 
including images split into multiple parts, such as the output produced by FTK Imager.
